## Research Domain Introduction and Data Collection:

**Project Description:** The purpose of this research is to report on the comparison between different nondestructive testing (NDT) technologies applied for the detection of defects in welded connections. NDT sensor technologies such as Ultrasonic Testing **(UT)**, Magnetic Particle Testing **(MT)** and Radiographic Testing **(RT)** may be applied for the detection of surface and subsurface defects in steel bridge members. However, each of these sensor technologies may have a different response to the same defect, based on the physics of the sensor. As a result, test results may vary between each one of the senor. Critical defects such as cracks may be detected by one sensor, but not by another, leading to inconsistent results and undermining confidence in the test results. Inconsistencies between **MT, UT and RT** sensors were identified in the study.

**Project Location:** [The Sherman Minton Bridge is a two span tied arch bridge spanning the Ohio River and connecting Indiana and Kentucky states.](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sherman+Minton+Bridge/@38.2787315,-85.8244487,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x88696cf146f65fed:0xec17b638d8fc4378!8m2!3d38.2787315!4d-85.82226) 

### 1. Research Ojective and Approach:

The objective of the research is to evaluate the consistency of test results from each of these technologies. In the study, MT, RT, and UT results from the inspection of the Sherman Minton Bridge were compared. Vertical butt welds in the tie girder were inspected between the months of June and December, 2011 using visual inspection - **VI, MT, UT and RT** technologies. During the course of the inspections, **21 cores** were removed from the bridge for **laboratory assessment** of their metallurgy and to characterize flaws at those locations. The result of these laboratory studies were compared **statistically** with the results from the NDT field test results. In addition, the NDT field test results obtained from testing all of the vertical butt welds in the bridge were compared to assess the consistency of the field test results.

### 2. Data Collection (On-Site & In-Lab):

A Forensic Information Model (FIM) was created by Thornton Tomasetti, Inc. from field inspection reports, including the previous inspection periods, to visualize the locations of the indications in butt welds along the tie girders of the bridge. Therefore, the locations of 21 cores were identified on FIM in Figures below:
