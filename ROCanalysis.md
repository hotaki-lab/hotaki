## 1. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Analysis:

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis can be used to assess the reliability of nondestructive testing (NDT) systems. An ROC curve can be used to evaluate the reliability of an inspection sensor by assessment of true positive versus false positive detection rates. In ROC analysis, the NDT method classification of each indication is compared to its true classification based on an appropriate threshold. Sensitivity and specificity are two important parameters for ROC analysis. **Sensitivity** is the proportion of correctly classified indications among all those that are truly positive; **specificity** is the proportion of correctly classified indications among all those that are truly negative.

### 2. Alternative Method for ROC Analysis:

Eng recommended two formats for data to be organized for ROC analysis (54). These formats are based on the inspectorâ€™s confidence rating. In the first format (Format-A), there is one of six possible ratings that can be applied to an indication. These ratings are defined from one to six as follows:
1 = Definitely Negative
2 = Probably Negative
3 = Possibly Negative
4 = Possibly Positive
5 = Probably Positive
6 = Definitely Positive
In the second format (Format-B), the dataset is divided into two parts (truly positive and truly negative observations). Then, the inspector rates each positive and negative indication on a confidence scale from 1 to 3 (i.e. low, moderate, and high). The latter format is most commonly used, and therefore was used for producing ROC curves from NDT data.
