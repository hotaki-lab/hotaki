## Data Analysis and Feature Engineering:

### 1. Selecting Features from Raw Data:

For comparison purposes, two senors were considered in detail (UT and RT) because capabilities of these two sensors are very close to each other and the preference of one over another is arguable. Therefore, technical gaps, advantages, and disadvantages of both UT and RT were thoroughly analyzed, identified, and compared through this research. MT inspection results were also considered for surface breaking flaws in 21 cores.

### 2. Defect Length Feature:

According to the results from 21 SMB cores, 22 flaws were detected by sectioning (excluding cores #2 and #3). The following Table indicates the **mean flaw length, standard deviation**, and number of flaws for RT, UT, and lab sectioning. UT results for Cores #14 and #1 indicated flaws with lengths of 8.5” and 11.2” respectively. These flaw lengths were greater than the core diameters. Since these two flaw lengths had significant effect on the standard deviation and mean values, the maximum flaw lengths (i.e. core diameters) were considered for both of these cores.
