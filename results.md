## Research Results & Future Work:

The objective of this research was to compare NDT technologies and to evaluate the inconsistencies between results of different techniques. After thorough analysis of the SMB field inspection and 21 cores data, the following conclusions regarding MT, RT, and UT techniques were made.

### 1. Lab vs. Field Core Results for MT:

* 3/9 core locations with surface-breaking flaws were detected by MT. Although these 9 cores were located either close to or behind the shelf plates, MT detected the flaws of 3 cores (Table 4-1 and Appendix-F).

### 2. Lab vs. Field Core Results for RT and UT:

**Correct Indication by Sensors:**
* 15 cores were considered for UT
* 16 cores were considered for RT
* 11/15 cores (73%) were inspected correctly by UT compared with the lab results.
* 7/16 cores (44%) were inspected correctly by RT compared with the lab results.

**Flaw Detectability of Sensors:**
* 14 cores had flaws (cores #2 and #3 were not included). 5 cores were healthy.
* Out of 14 cores, 10 cores were considered for UT (cores #8, #9, #12, and #13 were excluded due to their locations behind shelf plates).
* Out of 14 cores, 11 cores were considered for RT (excluded cores are the same as shown for UT except core #9).
* UT detected flaws of 7/10 cores (70%)
* RT detected flaws of 9/11 cores (82%)
* Although the RT flaw detection was greater than the UT, RT indicated some volumetric flaws instead of planar flaws for some cores. For example, RT indicated porosity and incomplete fusion for core #1 instead of a crack. Similarly, RT showed slag inclusion for core #11 instead of a crack. These indications of RT can be considered as missed flaws.
* Excluding cores #1 and #11, RT detected 7/11 flaws (64%).
* Overall flaw detectability of UT was greater than the RT.

**Flaw Characterization of Sensors:**
* Planar (2D) flaw detection of RT was proven weaker than UT
* 14 cores had planar flaws including surface and subsurface flaws
* RT detected cracks (planar flaws) of 5/11 cores (45%)
* RT missed cracks of 6 cores
* UT detected cracks (planar flaws) of 7/10 cores (70%)

**Field Data Results for RT and UT:**
The following conclusions were made based on the analysis of the field data from **352 butt welded joints** along the bridge:
* 79% of flaws (634/802), in the overall field inspection, were detected by UT
* 33% of flaws (265/802), in the overall field inspection, were detected by RT
* 12% of flaws (96/802), in the overall field inspection, were detected by both UT and RT

### 3. Recommendations and Future Research:

According to the data analyses of the Sherman Minton Bridge (SMB) and the literature survey, the following conclusions may be drawn:
* Based on the comparative study of UT and RT, and according to the assumptions used, **UT had successful results when implemented on SMB**.
* Observing the data from the SMB 21 cores, RT encountered numerous false positive indications. Therefore, RT image analysis should be done by expert inspectors.
For future research, construction of proper POD and ROC curves for performance of both UT and RT, based on the data from steel highway bridges, is recommended.
